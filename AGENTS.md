# Project Rules & Guidelines

## Git & Version Control Policy
- **Automatic Staging & Commit**: After completing and verifying code updates, the AI Agent should proactively run `git add` and `git commit -m "<descriptive message>"` to record the changes locally.
- **Push Policy**: **NEVER run `git push` automatically.** Pushing commits to remote repositories (GitHub) is strictly reserved for the USER to execute manually. Always prompt the user when commits are ready to push.

## Tiered Language & Communication Policy

| Layer | Language Standard | Rationale & Rules |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Code & Architecture** | **Strictly English** | Variable names, function identifiers, classes, interfaces, and code comments must be written in English to adhere to global engineering standards. |
| **Test Suites & Git Commits** | **Strictly English** | Test specs, assertion descriptions, test output logs, and Git commit messages must be in English for CI/CD and universal git log readability. |
| **CLI & User-Facing Tools** | **Adaptive i18n** | CLI tools (e.g. `.agents/scripts/`) must utilize the `src/i18n.js` dictionary engine to dynamically adapt outputs to the developer's environment (`$LANG`) or `--lang` flag. |
| **Project Documentation** | **Bilingual (EN + ZH)** | Maintain primary `README.md` (English) and secondary `README.zh-CN.md` (Chinese) with bidirectional navigation links at the top. |
| **Architecture Visualizations** | **Bilingual Showcase** | Visual architecture artifacts should provide both English and Chinese renders (e.g., `arch-en.html` and `arch-zh.html`) for multi-region audiences. |
| **Frontend UI Dictionaries** | **Multi-Locale Packs** | Frontend user-facing texts reside in `locales/{locale}/` dictionaries with 100% key synchronization across languages. |
| **Agent Chat Communication** | **Dynamic Language Match** | In conversational dialogs, strictly match the user's language: reply in Chinese if the user addresses you in Chinese, and reply in English if the user addresses you in English. |

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) & Self-Healing Policy
- **Red-Green-Refactor Flow**: For any new features or bug fixes, always write the reproducing or boundary test case first in `test/` (Red phase) before writing production logic (Green phase).
- **Offline Sandbox Execution**: All unit and integration tests run entirely inside the local execution environment without network dependencies, ensuring zero external token consumption on passing tests.
- **Self-Healing Loop**: If a test fails, capture the error trace, consult `reflexion-memory` for similar known issues, diagnose and repair root causes, and re-verify until 100% passing.

## Pre-Push Security & Code Quality Gatekeeper
- **Push-Time Gatekeeper Execution**: The security gatekeeper (`.agents/scripts/pre-push-check.js`) is triggered **strictly prior to `git push`** via the `.git/hooks/pre-push` hook or manually via `node .agents/scripts/runner.js pre-push-check`.
- **Hard Block on Sensitive Secrets**: Any unpushed commit containing hardcoded API keys (e.g., OpenAI, GitHub tokens, AWS keys, private keys) will be hard-blocked (exit code 1) from being pushed to remote repositories.
- **Dependency & Code Smell Advisories**: Automatically scans for high/critical CVEs via `npm audit` and flags code smell indicators (functions >80 lines, nesting depth >4) before pushing.

## Pre-Refactoring Blast-Radius Analysis Policy
- **Impact Assessment First**: Before modifying or refactoring existing core modules or exported functions in `src/`, the AI Agent should evaluate the blast radius using `node .agents/scripts/runner.js blast-radius --target <fileOrSymbol>`.
- **Targeted Test Execution**: After completing refactorings, verify all impacted test suites identified by the blast radius report to guarantee zero regressions across downstream callers.

## Ambiguous Intent Clarification Policy (大词与模糊意图反向澄清准则)
- **Macro Vision Term Interception (Hard Stop on Coding)**: Whenever a user prompt contains broad, unbounded macro terms (e.g., "build an e-commerce mall", "create a blog system", "build a social platform", "make an admin dashboard", "做一个商城/博客/社区/管理后台"), the AI Agent is **strictly prohibited from writing implementation code immediately**.
- **Interactive Socratic Interview (`/grill-me` & `ask_question`)**: The Agent must trigger a requirement discovery interview (channeling `/grill-me` via `ask_question` or structured multi-choice inquiry) to interrogate and clarify ambiguous assumptions, technical boundaries, core MVP scopes (v0.1 slicing), and business logic until the user's intent is deterministic and actionable.
- **Visual Blueprint First (`archify`)**: Once requirements and user stories are clarified, for any complex business logic, state transitions, or multi-step workflows, the Agent must first compile and deliver an interactive `archify` diagram (workflow/lifecycle HTML) for user visual confirmation and sign-off **before** initiating TDD red-green implementation.

## Dual-Phase Adversarial Review Policy (全生命周期双阶段红蓝对抗准则)
- **No Self-Approval for Core Changes**: When architecting, refactoring, or authoring sensitive components (`src/memory/`, `src/graph/`, `src/agent/`, `.agents/scripts/`), the authoring Agent (Blue Team) is strictly prohibited from self-approving plans or code without independent adversarial scrutiny.
- **Phase 1: Design-Phase RFC Inquest Gate (方案前置对抗门 - 审架构假设与死角)**:
  - **Timing**: Triggered immediately after drafting `implementation_plan.md` and before requesting user approval to write code.
  - **Mandatory Action**: The Blue Team MUST invoke an independent, read-only Red-Team Subagent (`Role: "Adversarial RFC Reviewer"`, `TypeName: "research"`) to interrogate the design: probe for LLM hallucination risks, unhandled edge cases, context-window overflow, asynchronous traps, and graceful degradation failures.
  - **Deliverable**: The Red Team issues a formal 《方案红队质询函》 (Design Adversarial Inquest). The Blue Team MUST publicly respond and integrate concrete defensive clauses and guardrails directly into `implementation_plan.md` under `## Red-Team Adversarial Inquest & Defensive Clauses` before requesting final user sign-off.
- **Phase 2: Code-Phase Commit Audit Gate (代码后置对抗门 - 审实现漏洞与隔离性)**:
  - **Timing**: Triggered after completing TDD implementation and passing all unit tests, strictly prior to any local `git commit`.
  - **Mandatory Action**:
    1. **Tier 1 (Automated Static Baseline)**: Run `node .agents/scripts/runner.js adversary-check --staged` on all staged diffs to catch baseline regressions (ACID transactions, test isolation, regex boundaries, VCS hygiene).
    2. **Tier 2 (Mandatory Independent Subagent Audit)**: Invoke an isolated read-only subagent (`Role: "Adversarial Code Auditor"`, `TypeName: "research"`) to stress-test the real Git Diff, check for silent degradations, and issue a formal 《代码红队裁决书》 (Code Adversarial Verdict).
- **Public Dialogue & Remediation Loop**: The Blue Team must publicly resolve every critical finding and add regression test cases before a local `git commit` is permitted. Silently bypassing the auditor or rubber-stamping changes is strictly forbidden.
